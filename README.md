Payment Gateway Integration is developed using HTML and CSS. There is simple donate button on homepage. On clicking the donate button, the user will land on the payment page where user can select the amount to be paid and the payment type, e.g. debit card, UPI, etc. Once the payment is done, invoice will be generated and email will be sent to the user for the payment received. The invoice will contain the amount.

For payment gateway, Razorpay is used.
